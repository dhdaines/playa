## PLAYA 0.2.4: 2024-12-02
- fix more embarrassing bugs largely regarding the creation of empty
  ContentObjects
- these are not actually all fixed because (surprise!) sometimes we
  neglect to map the characters in fonts correctly
- oh and also lots and lots of robustness fixes thanks to the pdf.js
  testsuite of pdf horrors

## PLAYA 0.2.3: 2024-11-28:
- release early and often
- fix some embarrassing bugs, again:
  - CMap parser did not recognize bfrange correctly (regression)
  - corner cases of inline images caused endless woe
  - documentation said document.structtree exists but nope it didn't

## PLAYA 0.2.2: 2024-11-27
- make everything quite a lot faster (25-35% faster than pdfminer now)
- fix some more pdfminer.six bugs and verify others already fixed
- really make sure not to return text objects with no text

## PLAYA 0.2.1: 2024-11-26
- fix serious bug on malformed stream_length
- report actual bounding box for rotated glyphs
  - eager API is no longer faster than pdfminer :( but it is more correct

## PLAYA 0.2: 2024-11-25
- expose form XObjects on Page to allow getting only their contents
- expose form XObject IDs in LayoutDict

      way pdfplumber expects it to work
